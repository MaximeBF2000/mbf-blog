I am a huge fan of automation, or more precisely… a huge fan of the concept.

I feel like it’s kind of shameful to say as a developer, but while I feel good about my productivity and optimisation skills, I can find myself struggling finding good useful automation ideas for my workflow.

<br />
So I took a look at precisely what I was doing a lot on a daily basis, and here’s
what I found :

- Initializing new coding projects
- Creating UI components & test suits
- Rewriting the same code between projects over & over again
- Searching through stack overflow for precise answer

And decided to create automations to accelerate all of those steps in my workflow.

## The ideas I came up with

- **To initialize projects** : I decided to create a shell script that would setup a github repository, as well as creating a new directory based on a chosen template, that finally automatically do a first commit to connect the directory to the repo
- **To create new components and test suits** : kind of the same idea with a shell script, the script creates the files and prefill them in the correct location, mostly useful when used with a short command line shortcut
- When it comes to **rewriting code** : I thought simplifying searching through my github would be cool, so I decided to make a simple search engine to look through all my repositories and making the copy pasting easy
- As for **finding stack overflow answers** : I usually search on google to find a stack overflow link, so I decided to take google results and only display those from stack overflow website.

Cool, we have our ideas, but now let's have a quick overview on how to build those automations.

## Shell scripting : 3 keypoints we need for the projects

To initialize a project & create prefilled folders and files, we need :

- First, to learn basics of bash / shell scripting : basically, any command you enter in a terminal can be written in your script, so basic of unix commands is good for us.
- Then, we need to access both script location path as well as execution path, so we can copy templates from location path to the execution path folder
- Finally, we need to be able to register our script as a single command accessible from anywhere in a terminal

### The HOW TOs

1. Basic linux command we need to know

Actually, in our case, we only need to know how to copy files and folders & basics code setup commands using git, yarn...

```bash
# Copy folder content
cp ./folder ./folder_copy

# Setup git & github repository
git init
yarn install
git remote add origin git@github.com:<github_username>/<repository_name>.git
git push -u origin master
```

2. Get script template locations & execution path
