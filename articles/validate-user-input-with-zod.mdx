Users' inputs validation has always been extremely important when building any type of service or API.

We know that not doing runtime checks and validation could result in a slower and much less secure application.

When you're starting off with input validation, you probably just add conditionnal statements every where in your code.
Making your code looking something like this :

```js
app.post((req, res) => {
  const body = req.body

  if (!body.email || !body.password) {
    throw new Error()
  }

  // Check if input respect the email format
  if (!isEmail(body.email)) {
    throw new Error()
  }

  if (body.password.length < 8 || body.password.length > 30) {
    throw new Error()
  }

  doSomething(body)
})
```

Doesn't look good, quite painful to develop and maintain right ?

Moreover, if you are using typescript, it should feel a bit counter intuitive to have to make your validation in such a declarative way.

But in fact, Typescript has a blind spot for runtime validation, as it only does build time checks.

Thankfully, there's a solution that will fit way better what you are trying to accomplish.

## What is Zod ?

Presenting Zod, a schema declaration and validation for your backend, that works hand in hand with Typescript to provide runtime validation.

Working with Zod is super easy, you create a schema, then you parse your users' inputs with the schema.

If the inputs does not fit the pattern of the schema, Zod will automatically throw an error that you can catch.

You can infer the type of the schema to statically type with Typescript.

Here's our above example made with Zod :

```ts
import { z } from 'zod'

const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z.string().min(8).max(30)
})

type User = z.infer<typeof userSchema>

app.post((req, res) => {
  const body = req.body as User

  // Zod does the checking and validation here
  userSchema.parse(body)

  doSomething(body)
})
```

You can also provide custom error message in your schema :

```ts
const userSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  password: z
    .string()
    .min(8, { message: 'Password should be at least 8 characters' })
    .max(30)
})
```

## Using Zod for more advanced schemas

Zod provides a bunch a useful prebuilt validators to check for an email, a url, a uuid, a cuid...

All of those that could be usefull on more complex schemas, for example :

```ts
const User = z.object({
  id: z.string().uuid()
  name: z.string().max(30)
  websiteUrl: z.string().url()
  ipAdress: z.string().ip()
  skills: z.array(z.string()).nonempty()

  // Create enums that you can infer with z.infer, or use z.nativeEnum() for external libs
  role: z.enum(['visitor', 'admin'])

  // Age must be an positive interger that is less than 100
  age: z.number().int().positive().lt(100)

  // UTC Format by default
  createdAt: z.string().datetime()
})
```

## The great part of Zod: Infering types

We've seen how usefull a validation library can be, but the real great thing about zod is its `z.infer` method that allows to work with typescript super easily. No need to maintain a relation between your types and schemas, as Zod does it on its own.

To get the proper type, you simply have to infer the type of your schema:

```ts
type YourSchemaType = z.infer<typeof yourSchema>
```

## Conclusion

As we've seen, if you are using Typescript for your backend, or even more if you use it accross the frontend and backend of your application, Zod can be a great solution to fill the blindspots of Typescript when it comes to runtime checking.

If you havn't tried it yet, feel free to share with me your first experience with it, I'm sure it will save you time with its great developer experience.
