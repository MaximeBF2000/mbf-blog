Here I go, I'm taking the plunge!

After three years of training in online business development and two years of experience in web development, I have decided to start a blog. But why a blog? Why don't I just create an Instagram page about programming like everyone seems to be doing these days?

In this article, I will try to explain to you my thoughts on the benefits of starting a blog for developing your online presence.

## 1 - Skills Developed as a Web Writer

For those of you who have already tried to start an online business on your own, you know that it's necessary to develop a variety of skills and juggle between different roles in your own company. However, you may have also noticed that not all skills are created equal.

Among the skills I have identified, here is a list of those that you could easily develop by maintaining a blog, and that I intend to continue developing myself through this blog:

1. Calendar organization
2. Copywriting - or how words can have a decisive impact on your business
3. SEO optimization - make yourself visible to Google and your clients will find you more easily

## 2 - SEO Optimization, make yourself inevitable on the web

Undoubtedly, one of the most well-known advantages of blogs is the enhancement of the SEO (Search Engine Optimization) for your website. When done correctly, SEO can bring tremendous added value to your business.

> Imagine never having to search for clients again, but instead having them come to you.

## 3 - Boost Your Branding and Gain Recognition from Experts

But the most important reason to start a blog in my opinion is to extend the reach of your ideas, experiences, and talent.

The truth is, there are many people with immense potential and impressive abilities, but only those who share it with the world receive recognition and the title of expert in their field.

By being consistent in sharing your knowledge and experiences, you not only provide your clients with tremendous added value but also give them a genuine reason to trust you.
