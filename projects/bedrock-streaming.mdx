## What is Bedrock Streaming?

Bedrock Streaming is a tech company that develops a streaming platform generation solution based on a single codebase. Some of their clients require the ability to manage millions of users or to be technically optimized enough to rank number one on a search engine.

## My Role at Bedrock

I joined Bedrock in 2021 and spent about 7 months there as a front-end React.js developer.

My role was to develop, maintain, and update visual components created by designers, develop application features written by product owners, write automated tests, conduct code reviews...

## What I Discovered at Bedrock

After about 2 years of coding my own projects or developing small-scale projects for SMEs and individuals as a freelancer, I joined a much larger company with about 300 internal and external employees, managing several major clients internationally... Far from my small side projects managed in my student dorm room.

And it was this massive difference that I was seeking, and it really taught me a lot. Until then, I had intentionally avoided large companies, thinking that I wouldn't enjoy that kind of experience. While looking for my next project, I found myself discussing this project and had a technical exchange with the lead developer of the recruitment team. As we talked, I liked the project, and the atmosphere felt during the exchange pleased me even more. Okay, it's an opportunity to develop new skills in an environment that interests me.

I was chosen for the assignment a few days later and arrived confident and motivated on the first day.

## First Day

I arrived on the first day feeling confident. I always understood everything very quickly when starting a new project.
They started by showing me around the premises, explaining a lot of things about the company... All good so far.
Then came the first meeting, a meeting with the team (three-quarters of them were on video due to Covid), and there I spent the 15 minutes of the meeting hearing terms that were completely unknown to me, first moment of pressure.
The presentation continued until I found myself in the codebase. To familiarize myself, the lead dev asked me to change the color of a logo. I thought the exercise was simple, but after 30 minutes, I started to feel overwhelmed. I began to think that I didn't have the level required for the assignment (yes, I used to stress quickly back then).
Probably seeing my expression, the lead dev decided to explain to me how to do it and probably did it in 2 minutes (1 minute 30 seconds to explain and 30 seconds to do it). Okay, I still have a lot to learn. I was a bit stressed but rather happy to see that it was going to be a real challenge.

### The Self-Taught Bet

After the initial stress, I started progressing quickly and began to produce results. I was fortunate to have received excellent mentoring at the beginning (Thanks [Slashgear](https://blog.slashgear.dev) ^^), which allowed me to quickly overcome that first stress and better understand the internal workings.
In any case, one thing is certain, with all this information to quickly grasp, I was glad that I had learned to learn effectively ^^.

## What I Was Able to Learn

Now that I can change the color of a logo in less than 2 hours (ðŸ’ª), I can truly observe and learn.

Rather luckily, I ended up in a team full of talent (if I'm being very objective).

Developers, integrators, product owners, designers, and testers, there is already a lot to learn within the team. But in addition to that, I am just a few meters away from SEO specialists and data scientists. Needless to say, I have been able to discover many professions and, more generally, observe the organization and the different interactions at this level of the company.
