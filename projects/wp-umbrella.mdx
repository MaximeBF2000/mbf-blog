## What is WP Umbrella ?

WP Umbrella is a SaaS that aims to make it easier to maintain tens or hundreds of WordPress websites in a single, simple, and beautifully designed interface. The app is made for freelancers and web agencies that offers WordPress creation and management for their clients.  
I joined as a Fullstack developer.

## The tech stack of the project

There is three part of the app, a web application, a WordPress plugin, as well as an API.

- On the frontend for the webapp : Using Next.js, Typescript and TailwindCSS for styling.
- For the API, using Node.js with Express.js.  
  It uses PostgreSQL as main database as well as Redis for caching.
- The WordPress plugin is made with PHP

Also using Docker to access database and LocalWP, a tool that allows to work on WordPress instances locally (usefull to dev a WordPress plugin)

## A few things I did in this project

During this project, I joined mostly to work on the webapp. I joined the project for a short time, during which I have :

- Helped design and integrate a new UI for a auth and onboarding
- Implemented social authentification to increase conversion
- Redesigned an error monitoring page
- Creating a Slack application to implement Slack alerting for WordPress PHP Errors
