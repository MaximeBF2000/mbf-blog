Working out has been a part of my routine for a long time now. In about 5 years, I tried several methods, diets, programs, and also workout application.

When working out, you want to track your performances, take notes on how you were feeling during the session (for example, in 5 years, I might have gone to the gym 2 hours after a party, which has tremendous impact on perfs).
So you can either do it old school with a notebook & pen, which is probably the best thing to do, but if you don't want to come with that, you can use a mobile app made for this.

As said before, I tried several of them over the years, it worked for me at the beginning, but free apps are quickly limited and you cannot always find all the features in the same app (being a student with no money, I was not willing to pay for a premium app, so I cannot tell if there are great).

And now that I can make my own, I'll do a custom-made app for more advanced workout sessions.

## So what do we want for a next level workout app ?

Let's review what could be great for our app :

- First, for trainings and exercices, we want barebone features : Instead of having a list of pre-made exercices, we want to be able to create our own exercices, with name, description, and even a video of to see how to make the movement (as you can make your movement evolve). We want to be able to choose between lifting exercices & timed exercices. Basically same barebone features for diets.
- For exercices, we want to be able to choose any number of reps or weights, floating numbers included, as well as taking notes on any reps.
- Setting up some gamification & custom push notifications (session reminder, groceries)
- Bringing community to the table

## Bringing community to the table

Working out solo or with friends is a very different story.
Wether it's for having a better social environement, a way easier-to-follow routine, or exchanging tips to progress way faster, community can have a massive impact, so we should definitively add it to the app.

Here are some ideas I have to do that :

- Being able to share trainings available on a marketplace (most should be free)
- Being able to join a team, and receive notifications when team members go to the gym, achieve a milestone...
- Share goals & progress on those goals
- Create PeerToPeer with certified coaches
