## The Origin: A Tool Born from Frustration

While working on [Prospease](/projects/prospease), my LinkedIn automation Chrome extension, I spent countless hours doing reverse engineering. Understanding how LinkedIn's API worked, what endpoints were being called, what data was being sent and received... This was essential to build a reliable automation tool.

The problem? Chrome's native Network tab in DevTools, while useful, was missing some key features that would have made my life so much easier:

- **No regex search** across URLs, headers, and bodies
- **No easy way to search inside response bodies**
- **No direct export to LLM-friendly format** for quick AI analysis
- **Limited filtering options** that required too many clicks

I found myself constantly copying requests, formatting them manually, and pasting them into ChatGPT to help me understand complex API responses. There had to be a better way.

## Building My Own Tool

As most developers do when they can't find the perfect tool, I decided to build my own.

### The Core Requirements

What I needed was simple but powerful:

- **Capture all network requests** in real-time (XHR, Fetch, documents, scripts...)
- **Advanced filtering** by HTTP method, status code, resource type, and URL patterns
- **Regex-powered search** across URLs, headers, and request/response bodies
- **In-response search** with match highlighting and navigation
- **One-click export** to cURL, JavaScript Fetch, and Python requests
- **LLM Details tab** with formatted output ready for AI analysis

### Technical Implementation

I built the extension using Chrome Extension Manifest V3, with a service worker handling the network capture and a DevTools panel for the UI. The architecture involves:

- `chrome.webRequest` API to intercept requests at multiple stages
- `chrome.devtools.network` API to capture response bodies
- Real-time messaging between the background script and DevTools panel

One interesting challenge was capturing request bodies. The `webRequest` API captures data at different stages (onBeforeRequest, onBeforeSendHeaders, onHeadersReceived, onCompleted), and I had to piece together the full picture of each request across these events.

## The Features That Save Me Hours

### Regex Search Everywhere

The killer feature for me is the ability to search with regex patterns across everything. Looking for all requests containing a specific user ID in the body? Done. Finding all endpoints matching a pattern? Easy. This alone probably saves me 30 minutes per reverse engineering session.

### LLM-Friendly Export

This was the feature I was most excited about. With one click, I can copy a beautifully formatted version of any request/response pair, optimized for pasting into ChatGPT or Claude. No more manual formatting, no more missing context.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

Because efficiency matters:

- `/` to focus the search input
- `Esc` to clear all filters
- `Tab` to navigate between matches in response body
- `Ctrl/Cmd + F` to search within a response

### Dark Mode

Because no developer tool is complete without it. 🌙

## What I Learned

Building a DevTools extension is quite different from a regular Chrome extension. The DevTools API has its own quirks and limitations. Here are some takeaways:

- **Response bodies are tricky**: Due to CORS restrictions and binary content, some response bodies simply aren't available. I had to handle these edge cases gracefully.
- **Performance matters**: When you're capturing 1000+ requests on a busy page, you need to be careful about memory and rendering performance.
- **Manifest V3 changes everything**: The move from background pages to service workers required a different approach to persistent state management.

## The Tool I Wish I Had Earlier

This extension has become an essential part of my development toolkit. Whether I'm reverse engineering an API, debugging a tricky network issue, or just trying to understand how a web app works under the hood, Network Analyzer is always open in my DevTools.

It's a tool I built for myself, but it's also a reminder that sometimes the best projects come from scratching your own itch. If you're doing any kind of web reverse engineering or API debugging, give it a try.
